# StudioHub - Design Studio Orchestration Platform

## Executive Summary

StudioHub is a centralized orchestration platform designed for Estudio Baum Arquitectos, a creative design studio specializing in architectural renovation, bespoke furniture design, and custom tapestry creation. The platform transforms fragmented WhatsApp communications with craftsmen into structured project data while serving as the single source of truth for all design projects, financial tracking, and creative workflow management.

## Problem Statement

The design studio faces critical operational challenges that impede their creative work:
- **Communication Chaos**: Craftsmen have limited digital skills, making quote collection and status tracking extremely time-consuming, pulling designers away from creative work
- **Manual Administrative Burden**: Invoice and quote generation is done manually, consuming valuable design time that should be spent on architectural concepts and creative development
- **Lack of Design Project Visibility**: No centralized system for tracking design iterations, project status, margins, and creative profitability
- **Design Cost Uncertainty**: Difficulty estimating costs for custom design work due to unreliable communication with specialized manufacturers and artisans

## Solution Overview

StudioHub empowers the design studio to focus on creativity while seamlessly managing the business side by:
- Integrating WhatsApp Business API as the primary communication channel with craftsmen and suppliers
- Automatically parsing messages to extract quotes and status updates for design projects
- Generating professional invoices and design proposals automatically from approved data
- Providing real-time margin and design project profitability tracking
- Centralizing all design documents, CAD files, and project communications
